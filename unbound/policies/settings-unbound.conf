  # Specifies the log file for Unbound. If no logfile is specified, syslog is used.
  # Uncomment the following line to enable logging to a file:
  use-syslog: no
  logfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.log"

  # Sets the verbosity level for logging. Higher values provide more detailed logs.
  verbosity: 3

  # Enables logging of incoming queries.
  log-queries: yes

  # Enables logging of outgoing replies.
  log-replies: yes

  # Specifies the network interfaces on which Unbound will listen for DNS queries.
  interface: 10.5.1.100
  interface: 10.5.1.105
  interface: 127.0.0.1
  
  # Sets the port number on which Unbound will listen for DNS queries.
  port: 53#35
  #port: 853

  # Configures access control rules for the specified network ranges.
  # The "allow" keyword grants access to the specified network.
  access-control: 10.5.1.0/24 allow
  access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow
      
  # Enables QNAME minimization, which reduces the amount of information sent in DNS queries.
  qname-minimisation: yes

  # Enables support for IPv4 DNS queries.
  do-ip4: yes

  # Enables support for UDP transport for DNS queries.
  do-udp: yes

  # Enables support for TCP transport for DNS queries.
  do-tcp: yes

  # Enables support for IPv6 DNS queries. Set this to "yes" if you have IPv6 connectivity.
  do-ip6: yes

  # Specifies the preference for IPv4 or IPv6 when both are available.
  # Set this to "no" unless you have native IPv6 connectivity.
  prefer-ip6: no

  # Specifies the location of the root hints file, which contains the addresses of the root DNS servers.
  # This is only necessary if you have manually downloaded the root hints file.
  # If you use the default dns-root-data package, Unbound will find it automatically.
  root-hints: "/etc/unbound/root.hints"

  # Enables hardening of glue records, ensuring that glue records are only trusted if they are within the server's authority.
  harden-glue: yes

  # Enables hardening of DNSSEC-stripped data, requiring DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones.
  # If such data is absent, the zone becomes BOGUS.
  harden-dnssec-stripped: yes

  use-caps-for-id: no

  # Sets the EDNS buffer size to 1472 bytes, which is the recommended value for DNS Flag Day 2020.
  # This helps avoid fallback to TCP and improves the reliability of DNS queries over UDP.
  edns-buffer-size: 1472

  # Enables prefetching of close to expired message cache entries for frequently queried domains.
  prefetch: yes

  # Sets the number of threads used by Unbound. One thread is usually sufficient for most use cases.
